# Storytelling
For this project, I revisited a dataset I had previously analysed for another task. I found this dataset intriguing and believed it had potential for storytelling. The dataset, known as CardiGoodFitness, focused on estimating treadmill usage among a specific group of individuals. What fascinated me most about this dataset was its comparison of gender and marital status with treadmill usage. This aspect became the focal point of my analysis, shaping the narrative arc and presentation.

Given my prior familiarity with the data and having conducted previous analyses, I had a clear idea of the direction I wanted to take in crafting the narrative arc. Assembling the information was an enjoyable process.

Once the narrative arc was complete, I began compiling a concise presentation (presentation can be viewed [here](https://github.com/joanneabioye/CardioGoodFitness-Presentation/blob/main/README.md)). To enhance the storytelling, I created visual aids to provide a deeper understanding. I aimed to keep the presentation brief and focused, utilizing strong visuals to facilitate comprehension.

Overall, I found this project to be enjoyable. It was rewarding to delve into an intriguing topic and document my findings. The project also left room for further exploration, with numerous potential avenues for analysing factors related to increasing sales.
